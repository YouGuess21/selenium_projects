# Selenium Projects

As stated above, this repository contains all the selenium scripts by me.

These scripts are aimed to help me and people around me in daily life.


Little backstory lol: This repository started when I saw my mom working endlessly filling trivial entries into her work site. I got mad and wondered if I could somehow automate that process.. hence the beginning.

I plan to make more and more scripts for automation and scraping primarily.
